For Loops
    Pseudo-Code
        for item in [LIST]
        do
        [Commands]
        done
    The LIST can be a series of strings seperated by spaces, a range of numbers, output of a command, 
    an array, and so on. All loops are great at automating repetitive tasks.
    
    Break and Continue
        Break-terminates the current loop and continues to the next statement.
            if[[<Condition>]]; then
                break
            fi
        Continue-The continue statement exits the current iteration of the loop and passes program control to the next iteration. 
        "Skips to the next iteration"
            if[[<Condition>]]; then
                continue
            fi
While and Until Loops
    While Loops are used to perform given commands an unk number of times as long as the given condition is True.
    
    Until Loops are used to perform given commands an unk number of times as long as the given condition is False.
